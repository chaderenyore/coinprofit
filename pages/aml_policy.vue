      <p>
        Feskyemma Nig. Limited is committed to the highest standards of
        compliance against money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing
        (CTF). The objective of the Companies Policy against Money Laundering
        and Terrorism Financing is to actively prevent the risks of these
        matters. To help the government combat the financing of terrorism and
        money laundering activities, the law requires all financial institutions
        to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person
        who opens an account. We have an obligation to report suspicious client
        activity relevant to money laundering. Money Laundering: The process of
        converting funds received from illegal activities (such as fraud,
        corruption, terrorism, etc.) into other funds or investments that appear
        legitimate to hide or distort the actual source of funds.
      </p>
      <h3>
        The money laundering process can be divided into three sequential
        stages:
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span class="dot"></span>Placement. At this stage, the funds are turned
        into financial instruments, such as checks, bank accounts, and money
        transfers, or they can be used to buy high-value goods that can be
        resold. They can also be physically deposited in banks and non-bank
        institutions (eg exchange houses). To avoid suspicion on the part of the
        company, the bleach can also make several deposits instead of depositing
        the entire sum at once, this form of placement is called smurf.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="dot"></span>Layers. The funds are transferred or moved to
        other accounts and other financial instruments. It is done to disguise
        the origin and interrupt the indication of the entity that carried out
        the multiple financial transactions. Moving funds and changing their
        form makes it difficult to track the money that is being laundered.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="dot"></span>Integration. The funds are re-circulated as
        legitimate to purchase goods and services.
