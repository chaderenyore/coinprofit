      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="dot"></span>Professional Advisors: we may share personal
        information with our professional advisors such as lawyers and
        accountants where doing so is necessary to facilitate the services they

      <h3>4. PERSONAL INFORMATION RETENTION</h3>

      <p>
        We keep personal information for as long as reasonably necessary for the

      <h3>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

      <p>
        CoinProfit is headquartered in the US. The US may have data protection
        laws less stringent than or otherwise different from the laws in the EU.
        Transfers of your personal information to CoinProfit in the US are
        necessary to perform the agreement we have entered into, or are about to
        enter into, with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before July 16, 2020, we relied on our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
        certification to transfer personal information from the EU to the U.S.
        On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled that the EU-U.S.
        Privacy Shield is no longer available for these transfers. Before
        September 8, 2020, we relied on our Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
        certification to transfer personal information from Switzerland to the
        US but on September 8, 2020 the Swiss Federal Data Protection and
        Information Commissioner determined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
        is no longer available for these transfers. We continue to comply with
        the Privacy Shield Principles described in the Privacy Shield section
        below as required by the US Department of Commerce.

      <p>
        CoinProfit is responsible for the processing of personal information it
        receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers
        to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. CoinProfit complies
        with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal
        information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability
        provisions.
      </p>

      <h3>7. CHILDREN</h3>

      <p>
        Our Service is not directed to children who are under the age of 18.
        CoinProfit does not knowingly collect personal information from children
        under the age of 18. If you believe that a child under the age of 18
        provided personal information to CoinProfit please <u>contact us</u> and
        we will delete that information.
      </p>

      <h3>8. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h3>

      <p>
        The Service may contain links to other websites not operated or
        controlled by CoinProfit, including social media services (“Third Party
        Sites”). The information that you share with Third Party Sites will be
        governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of service of the
